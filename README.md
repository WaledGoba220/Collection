# üìù Portfolio Overview & Public Summary
This repository presents a focused data analysis portfolio demonstrating end-to-end proficiency across four critical toolsets: Excel, Python, SQL, and Power BI.

Each project showcases the practical application of the data lifecycle, from initial data cleaning and transformation (Python/SQL) to advanced modeling (Excel/DAX), culminating in interactive business intelligence reporting (Power BI).

This portfolio highlights my ability to turn raw data into actionable insights using a rigorous, multi-platform approach.
